# First Steps in Open Source: My Experience with a Successful PR Merge
By ***Syed Ali Ul Hasan*** | 01 September 2024

### Introduction

Contributing to open source can be a significant milestone for any developer, offering a chance to engage with real-world projects and collaborate with a global community. For me, it has been a journey of growth, learning, and accomplishment. This blog post documents my experience with my first pull request (PR) being successfully merged into an open-source project, outlining the technical challenges encountered, the steps taken to address them, and the process of getting my PR accepted.

### The Spark: An Open Source Conference

My journey began when I attended an open-source conference at IIT Kanpur with a few friends. It was here that I realized just how vast and vibrant the open-source community is. The discussions, the people, and the sheer potential intrigued me. Encouraged by a friend, I decided to explore some reputable open-source organizations. One name that stood out was the Palisadoes Foundation, and this is where my story begins.

### About the Project

The **Palisadoes Foundation** is a non-profit organization focused on empowering underrepresented communities, particularly in the Caribbean, through technology education and resources. One of its key projects is **Talawa**, an open source project to help community-based organizations such as clubs, neighborhood groups, volunteer associations, non-profits and small religious institutions manage their daily activities. Most user interaction is via a mobile app.

By contributing to the Talawa API, developers support a project that has a real-world impact on community organizations and aligns with the foundation's mission of promoting inclusivity in technology.

### The Issue

During the conference, I started looking into the unassigned issues in the Talawa API repository and requested to be assigned to one. A couple of days later, I was assigned my first issue: **Test Run time was too long (#2236)**. The project was using Vitest for testing, and the test execution time was far from optimal.

Initially, the complexity of the task felt overwhelming. I remember staring at the issue description, a mix of excitement and apprehension coursing through me. I was unsure if I could handle it, but I was also excited by the challenge. I decided to dive deep into the codebase, determined to find a solution.

### Understanding the Codebase

Familiarizing myself with the codebase was the first hurdle. The project was extensive, and understanding the intricacies of the testing setup took time. I spent hours reading through documentation, exploring the code, and gathering any help I could find online. This phase was critical in building the confidence I needed to tackle the issue.

___

### Implementing the Solution

After gaining a good understanding of the codebase, I identified the key areas that needed modification. The existing setup used the following command to run tests:

```json 
"test": "vitest run --pool forks --poolOptions.forks.singleFork --coverage"
```

This configuration was suboptimal, leading to long test run times. After careful consideration, I proposed changing it to:

```json
"test": "vitest run --pool=threads --no-file-parallelism --coverage"
```

This change introduced test parallelism, significantly reducing the CI time. 
- It reduced the test runtime from **20 minutes** to **under 5 minutes**.

The key to this improvement was the use of thread-based parallelism (`--pool=threads`). This allows multiple tests to run concurrently, utilizing the available CPU cores more efficiently. However, to prevent potential race conditions, I also included the `--no-file-parallelism` flag, ensuring that tests within the same file run sequentially.

___

### Submitting the Pull Request

With the solution in place, I submitted my first pull request: **ci: add parallelism to reduce tests CI time (#2490)**. 

The PR was reviewed promptly, but I was asked to provide videos showing the before and after effects of my changes. This request made me nervous - I hadn't anticipated needing to provide such detailed evidence. However, I understood the importance of demonstrating the impact of my changes clearly.

Additionally, a reviewer pointed out a potential issue: while parallelism could speed up tests, it might also introduce race conditions, making some tests flaky. This feedback was eye-opening, showing me the complexities involved in optimizing test performance.

___

### Challenges and Learnings

Through this process, I learned several important lessons:

- While parallelism can improve performance, it requires careful consideration to avoid issues like race conditions.
- Tests that depend on the same database information could conflict when run in parallel.
- The reviewer suggested grouping tests based on thread affinity to mitigate this risk.

I was also asked to raise a new issue to address this concern, which I did: **Group Tests Based on Thread Affinity - Follow-up to Issue #2236 (#2491)**. This marked my first-ever issue raised on GitHub, adding another milestone to my open-source journey.

### The Merge

Finally, after addressing the feedback and making the necessary adjustments, my PR was merged. Seeing my contribution accepted into the codebase was immensely satisfying. It validated the effort I had put in and motivated me to continue contributing to open source. I remember the moment I saw the "Merged" status - it felt like a significant achievement, a tangible result of my hard work and learning.

### Conclusion

This experience provided valuable insights into the open-source development process. It showed me the importance of careful coding, thorough testing, and clear communication in a collaborative environment. Contributing to an open-source project was a learning opportunity that expanded my understanding of software development practices.

While this was just a small step, it gave me a glimpse into the vast world of open-source development. I look forward to continuing to learn and potentially contribute to more projects in the future.

If you're considering your first steps into open source, here are a few tips based on my experience:

1. Start small: Look for "good first issue" labels in repositories.
2. Don't be afraid to ask questions: The community is often very supportive of newcomers.
3. Be patient and persistent: Understanding a new codebase takes time.
4. Learn from feedback: Code reviews are invaluable learning opportunities.
5. Document your process: It helps others and solidifies your own understanding.

Remember, every contribution, no matter how small, can be valuable. If you're interested in open source, give it a try â€“ you might be surprised by what you learn.
